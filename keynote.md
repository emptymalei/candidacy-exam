P7: Why Do Neutrinos Oscillate? Mention I am going to demonstrate neutrino oscillations using two flavor. Three flavor is only going to make the math more complicated.



## Matter Interaction Feynman Diagrams



When we talk about matter, for example in the Sun, we mean we have a lot of electrons and nucleus. 

There is this neutral current interaction,  different flavors interact with electrons and quarks in the same manner, which is only causing a potential that is proportional to identity. We can drop this effect because identity in Hamiltonian is only going to cause a global phase.

But electrons also interact with electron flavor through charged current. And this will cause the system to have a electron flavor specific potential. If we calculate the forward scatter amplitude, we getâ€¦.

## MSW Effect and Solar Neutrinos

Now we have two states in this matter basis, the heavy state and the light state. When we talk about adabatic propagation, we mean the system doesn't jump between these heave and light states.

In the figure, we have dense matter on the left while the matter desnity approaching vacuum on the right. Upper bar means the probability of finding the system to be in heavy state and the lower bar means in light state. As the matter profile doesn't change too fast, the system undergoes adiabatic propagation and the length of the bars doesn't change. For example, if the system starts with completely heavy state , it will always remain on heavy state.

Since almost all neutrinos produced in the sun are electron neutrinos, and electron flavor neutrinos experience a big potential, electron flavor almost means heavy state. So we have the system starts with a state that is mostly heavy state and it remains this way. However, during the propagation, heavy state is going to have less electron flavor until some point, we have equal mixing which is MSW resonance. As it approaches vacuum, we have only about 1/3 of the probability to find the neutrinos to be on electron flavor state.
